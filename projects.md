<p>This project uses corpus-based and experimental
          methods to explore how metaphor and grammar can influence attitudes and reasoning
          about immigrantsÂ and immigration policy in the United States. We are
          interested in the force dynamics in metaphoric framing; understanding how shifts in the force-dynamic construal of a
          target concept (e.g., a social problem such as immigration) lead to shifts in attitudes and reasoning about
          that target concept (e.g., "immigrants are flooding over the border", "immigrants are trickling over the border").
