<p>My undergraduate and graduate studies focused primarily on the formation of meaning via interactions between language, cognition, and ideology from a cognitive and functional perspective. I researched sociocultural identity as mediated by language using corpus-based and behavioral methods.</p>

<img id='framing'></a></div>
<div><p>This <a href='https://sisu.ut.ee/sites/default/files/proovin/files/moorman.pdf'>project</a> uses both corpus-based and experimental methods to explore how metaphor and grammar can influence attitudes and reasoning about immigrants and immigration policy in the United States. Of interest is force dynamics in metaphoric framing, and understanding how shifts in the force-dynamic construal of a target concept (e.g., "immigrants are flooding over the border" vs. "immigrants are trickling over the border") lead to shifts in attitudes and reasoning about that target concept (e.g., sentiment towards immigrants and access to socio-economic resources).</p></div>

<div class='img big'><a href="http://neurocritic.blogspot.com/2006/12/positive-voltage-does-not-equal.html" target="_blank"><img id="eeg"></a></div>
<div><p>This project uses EEG to measure ERPs related to the online processing of novel and conventional metaphor. We are interested in how different types of lexical priming (e.g., category-based mappings, comparison-based mappings) affect novel metaphor comprehension. We want to better understand the degree to which semantically congruent conventional, or primary, metaphors can facilitate processing of novel metaphors.</p></div>

<div><p>This <a href='https://github.com/kariemoorman/iat-weat-wefat/blob/main/bias_and_cognition_presentation_2018_moorman_karie.pdf' target="_blank">project</a> examines cognitive bias, comparing unconscious or implicit bias with conscious bias across numerous sociocultural groups, topics, and events (e.g., immigration, ethnicity, elections). We conduct survey-based experiments for adult participants in the United States comprised of a series of implicit association tests (IAT), bias inventory metrics, political ideology metrics, and free response questions allowing participants to self-assess their own bias. We compare results with those found in large-scale language models using WEAT/WEFAT <a href='https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aal4230' target="_blank">(Caliskan, Bryson, & Narayanan, 2017)</a> trained on various corpora (e.g., Twitter, Reddit, Wikipedia, News, CommonCrawl) across multiple languages(e.g., English, Spanish, Chinese).</p></div>

<div class="manual-subtitle">Morality & Emotion</div>
<div class='img'><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31829720/" target="_blank">
<img id='emotion'></a></div>
<div><p>This <a href='https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337925035_Morality_is_relative_Anger_disgust_and_aggression_as_contingent_responses_to_sibling_versus_acquaintance_harm'  target="_blank">project</a> examines moral emotions (e.g., anger and aggression) from a sociofunctional perspective in the context of harm inflicted on siblings. The studies build upon prior research by Molho, Tybur, Güler, Balliet, and Hofmann (2017), who suggest that anger reactions to moral violations are more intense when the wrongdoing affects oneself compared to when it affects acquaintances. The rationale behind this heightened anger response is that aggressive confrontation is evolutionarily incentivized to protect one's fitness, as it is inherently risky. These findings replicate and extend the sociofunctionalist account of moral emotions to include the context of kinship relationships, suggesting that people are more likely to respond with anger and a willingness to confront wrongdoers when harm affects themselves or their siblings. This is consistent with the theory that such reactions evolved to protect fitness.</p></div>

<div><p>The <a href="https://metanet.icsi.berkeley.edu/metanet/" target="_blank">MetaNet Project</a>
 is a multi-year effort to systematize novel and conventional metaphor detection for large-scale analyses. The goal is to identify and analyze the metaphors people use to discuss and reason about a broad range of topics and domains (e.g., relationships, education, poverty, immigration), across multiple languages (e.g., US English, Mexican Spanish, Russian, Farsi).
